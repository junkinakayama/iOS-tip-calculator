Prework for codepath class

-How many hours did it take?

The initial work took me around an hour, but I spent around 3-4 extra hours playing around with a bunch of stuff and trying different things. Sometimes my math didnt add up correctly, so it took a while debugging that.

-Required and optional stories completed

I believe the only things required was to add a input and produce an output of the total bill + tip. I also played around with the text and added different colors, along with adding an app icon.
